# MAME Raspberry Pi Utilities

Some small utilities for building out a MAME arcade appliance with a Raspberry Pi running Debian-based Linux (the Raspberry Pi OS-lite flavor).

Mostly based off of the fantastic work of sonicprod in his [tutorial for a dedicated MAME Appliance](https://gist-github-com.translate.goog/sonicprod/f5a7bb10fb9ed1cc5124766831e120c4?_x_tr_sl=fr&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=fr) but I made some tweaks to some of the scripting and configuration to fit my project and preferences.
